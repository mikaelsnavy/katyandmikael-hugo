                    <h4>7:45 AM - Jet Boats</h4>
                    <p class="txt9">We are starting the day early with a 104 mile jet boat ride up the Wild and Scenic Rogue River! We will be spread across two big boats and the trip starts at 8 AM (but folks need to arrive at  7:45 AM). Cost is $50 per person. The trip will be around 7 hours total with a stop for lunch in the middle (please bring money for this) of the ride. We expect to be back around 4 PM. Please join us - this will be a blast and we are SO excited to go on a fun adventure with friends and family. The Rogue River is a super special place to us and this section of the river is ONLY open to people with permits (which we have reserved)! We have a couple spots left if you would like to join! Please let us know via the <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="/contact/">contact page</a>.</p><br><br>
                    <h4>7:00 PM - Welcome Beach Party</h4>
                    <p class="txt9">In lieu of a traditional rehearsal dinner, we will be gathering with any guests in the area at about 7:00 PM for a welcome beach dinner and party (look <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="/directions#venuemap">here for map</a>). ALL ARE WELCOME! We will have pizza and beer (as well as V/GF food options). Afterwards, we plan on spending quality time with all of you around a cozy bonfire. Please bring warm clothing as well as a chair and/or blanket to sit on. This will be a casual event, so feel free to embrace your inner beach bum vibes.</p><br /><br />
