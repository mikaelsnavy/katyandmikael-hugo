                        Friday July 12 - Jetboats and Rehearsal Dinner
                    </h2>
                    <p class="txt9">We are starting the day with a 104 mile Jet Boat ride up the Wild and Scenic Rogue River! We will charter one or two big boats and the trip starts at 8am. Cost is $50 per person. The trip will be around 7 hours total so we should be back between 3-4pm. Please join us - this will be a blast and we are SO excited to go on a fun adventure with friends and family. The Rogue River is a super special place to us and this section of the river is ONLY open to people with permits (which we have reserved)! Please let us know ahead of time if you want to join us for jetboats via the <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="/rsvp/">RSVP page</a>.</p><br><br><p class="txt9">We will be doing a casual rehearsal dinner at 7pm on Friday night. We are planning on doing pizza and maybe a beach bonfire outside at Crook Point. More details to come!</p><br /><br />

                        Saturday July 13 - The Wedding!
                    </h2>
                    <p class="txt9">The wedding starts at 3pm on the Arch Rock main lawn at Crook Point! We can't wait to see you! The dress code is cocktail attire, and please wear comfortable shoes! The wedding will take place outdoors on a grassy lawn which will make walking in heels difficult. The party will go from 3pm - midnight (or maybe later if you want to hang for the after-party), so make sure to bring a warm coat for the evening too! It may get a little chilly.</p><br /><br />

                        Sunday July 14 - Check out and River Day in the Redwoods
                    </h2>
                    <p class="txt9">Our checkout time at Crook Point is at 11am. After that, we are driving to <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=413">Jedediah Smith State Park</a> to spend the day along the Smith River relaxing in the sun! It's only about 45 minutes away and it's BEAUTIFUL! Brilliant turquoise water, a big beach area, and redwoods? Yes please. Join us if you'd like to spend a few more hours in paradise before heading home!</p>
